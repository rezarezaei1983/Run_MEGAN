# Run_MEGAN
The script named 'Run_MEGANv3.2_Scripts.sh' and modified Shell scripts (*modified.csh) should be placed alongside the original ones in the MEGAN. After the initial adjustment, you must only execute the 'Run_MEGANv3.2_Scripts.sh' script. This script automatically sets the parameters and runs the modified Shell scripts, which causes a significant reduction in execution time.
